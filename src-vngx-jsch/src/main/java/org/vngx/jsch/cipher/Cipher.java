/**
 * <p>{@code Cipher} defines an interface for an algorithm for performing
 * encryption or decryption.  Ciphers are used for encrypting/decrypting packets
 * sent with the SSH protocol.  The abstraction provided by this interface 
 * allows implementations to specify how the cipher should be implemented.</p>
 *
 * <p>An encryption algorithm and a key will be negotiated during the key
 * exchange.  When encryption is in effect, the packet length, padding length,
 * payload, and padding fields of each packet MUST be encrypted with the given
 * algorithm.</p>
 *
 * <p>The encrypted data in all packets sent in one direction SHOULD be
 * considered a single data stream.  For example, initialization vectors SHOULD
 * be passed from the end of one packet to the beginning of the next packet. All
 * ciphers SHOULD use keys with an effective key length of 128 bits or more.</p>
 *
 * <p>The ciphers in each direction MUST run independently of each other.
 * Implementations MUST allow the algorithm for each direction to be
 * independently selected, if multiple algorithms are allowed by local policy.
 * In practice however, it is RECOMMENDED that the same algorithm be used in
 * both directions.</p>
 *
 * <p>The following ciphers are defined in the SSH Transport Layer Protocol:
 * <pre>
 *	3des-cbc         REQUIRED          three-key 3DES in CBC mode
 *	blowfish-cbc     OPTIONAL          Blowfish in CBC mode
 *	twofish256-cbc   OPTIONAL          Twofish in CBC mode, with a 256-bit key
 * 	twofish-cbc      OPTIONAL          alias for "twofish256-cbc" (this is being retained for historical reasons)
 * 	twofish192-cbc   OPTIONAL          Twofish with a 192-bit key
 * 	twofish128-cbc   OPTIONAL          Twofish with a 128-bit key
 * 	aes256-cbc       OPTIONAL          AES in CBC mode, with a 256-bit key
 * 	aes192-cbc       OPTIONAL          AES with a 192-bit key
 * 	aes128-cbc       RECOMMENDED       AES with a 128-bit key
 * 	serpent256-cbc   OPTIONAL          Serpent in CBC mode, with a 256-bit key
 *	serpent192-cbc   OPTIONAL          Serpent with a 192-bit key
 * 	serpent128-cbc   OPTIONAL          Serpent with a 128-bit key
 * 	arcfour          OPTIONAL          the ARCFOUR stream cipher with a 128-bit key
 * 	idea-cbc         OPTIONAL          IDEA in CBC mode
 * 	cast128-cbc      OPTIONAL          CAST-128 in CBC mode
 * 	none             OPTIONAL          no encryption; NOT RECOMMENDED

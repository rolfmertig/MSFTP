/**
 * <p>Empty implementation of {@code Cipher} to be used when no cipher is
 * required.  This should *ONLY* be used for debugging purposes... the RFC spec
 * for SSH strongly suggests that the client must notify the user whenever
 * CIPHER NONE is being used as data is being sent unencrypted.</p>
 *
 * <p>The "none" algorithm specifies that no encryption is to be done. Note that
 * this method provides no confidentiality protection and it is NOT RECOMMENDED.
 * Some functionality (e.g., password authentication) may be disabled for
 * security reasons if this cipher is chosen.</p>
 *
 * <p><a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4253#section-6.3">RFC 4253 - The
 * Secure Shell (SSH) Transport Layer Protocol: Encryption</a></p>

/**
 * <p>Interface to define an algorithm which generates pseudo-random data used
 * in cryptographic processes.</p>
 *
 * <p>The SSH protocol binds each session key to the session by including random
 * session specific data in the hash used to produce session keys.  Special care
 * should be taken to ensure that all of the random numbers are of good quality.
 * If the random data here (e.g., Diffie-Hellman (DH) parameters) are pseudo-
 * random, then the pseudo-random number generator should be cryptographically
 * secure (i.e., its next output not easily guessed even when knowing all
 * previous outputs) and, furthermore, proper entropy needs to be added to the
 * pseudo-random number generator.  [RFC4086] offers suggestions for sources of
   random numbers and entropy.  Implementers should note the importance of
 * entropy and the well-meant, anecdotal warning about the difficulty in
 * properly implementing pseudo-random number generating functions.</p>
 *
 * <p>The amount of entropy available to a given client or server may sometimes
 * be less than what is required.  In this case, one must either resort to
 * pseudo-random number generation regardless of insufficient entropy or refuse
 * to run the protocol.  The latter is preferable.</p>

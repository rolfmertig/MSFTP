/**
 * <p>Interface for defining an algorithm which supports compressing and
 * decompressing byte data for an SSH session.</p>
 *
 * <p>If compression has been negotiated, the 'payload' field (and only it) will
 * be compressed using the negotiated algorithm.  The 'packet_length' field and
 * 'mac' will be computed from the compressed payload.  Encryption will be done
 * after compression.</p>
 *
 * <p>Compression MAY be stateful, depending on the method.  Compression MUST be
 * independent for each direction, and implementations MUST allow independent
 * choosing of the algorithm for each direction.  In practice however, it is
 * RECOMMENDED that the compression method be the same in both directions.</p>
 *
 * <p>The following compression methods are currently defined:</p>
 * <pre>
 *		none     REQUIRED        no compression
 *		zlib     OPTIONAL        ZLIB (LZ77) compression
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p><strong>Note:</strong> Implementations may not be thread-safe and should
 * be externally synchronized.</p>
 *
 * <p><strong>Note:</strong> Instances should be created using the
 * {@code AlgorithmManager} factory.</p>
 *

 * Secure Shell (SSH) Transport Layer Protocol: 6.2. Compression</a></p>

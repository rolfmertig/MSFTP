/**
 * <p>Abstract class for defining key exchange algorithm implementations.  After
 * the SSH_MSG_KEXINIT message exchange, the key exchange algorithm is run.  It
 * may involve several packet exchanges, as specified by the key exchange
 * method.</p>
 *
 * <p>The key exchange produces two values: a shared secret K, and an exchange
 * hash H.  Encryption and authentication keys are derived from these.  The
 * exchange hash H from the first key exchange is additionally used as the
 * session identifier, which is a unique identifier for this connection.  It is
 * used by authentication methods as a part of the data that is signed as a
 * proof of possession of a private key.  Once computed, the session identifier
 * is not changed, even if keys are later re-exchanged.</p>
 *
 * <p>Each key exchange method specifies a hash function that is used in the key
 * exchange.  The same hash algorithm MUST be used in key derivation.  Here,
 * we'll call it HASH.</p>

/**
 * <p>Implementation of <code>Request</code> to send a X11 request.</p>
 *
 * <p>X11 forwarding may be requested for a session by sending a
 * SSH_MSG_CHANNEL_REQUEST message.  It is recommended that the
 * 'x11 authentication cookie' that is sent be a fake, random cookie, and that
 * the cookie be checked and replaced by the real cookie when a connection
 * request is received.</p>
 *
 * <p>X11 connection forwarding should stop when the session channel is closed.
 * However, already opened forwardings should not be automatically closed when
 * the session channel is closed.</p>
 *
 * <p><a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4254">RFC 4254 - The Secure Shell
 * (SSH) Connection Protocol</a></p>

/**
 * Base implementation of <code>UserAuth</code> which performs the user
 * authorization for a given SSH session.  Implementations can define how the
 * user should be authorized for the session.  This class is part of the public
 * JSch API to allow developers to provide other mechanisms for user auth.
 *
 * The server drives the authentication by telling the client which
 * authentication methods can be used to continue the exchange at any given
 * time.  The client has the freedom to try the methods listed by the server in
 * any order.  This gives the server complete control over the authentication
 * process if desired, but also gives enough flexibility for the client to use
 * the methods it supports or that are most convenient for the user, when
 * multiple methods are offered by the server.
 *
 * Authentication methods are identified by their name.  The "none" method is
 * reserved, and MUST NOT be listed as supported.  However, it MAY be sent by
 * the client.  The server MUST always reject this request, unless the client is
 * to be granted access without any authentication, in which case, the server
 * MUST accept this request.  The main purpose of sending this request is to get
 * the list of supported methods from the server.
 *
 * The server SHOULD have a timeout for authentication and disconnect if the
 * authentication has not been accepted within the timeout period. The
 * RECOMMENDED timeout period is 10 minutes.  Additionally, the implementation
 * SHOULD limit the number of failed authentication attempts a client may
 * perform in a single session (the RECOMMENDED limit is 20 attempts).  If the
 * threshold is exceeded, the server SHOULD disconnect.
 *
 * All authentication requests MUST use the following message format.  Only the
 * first few fields are defined; the remaining fields depend on the
 * authentication method.
 *
 *		byte      SSH_MSG_USERAUTH_REQUEST
 *		string    user name in ISO-10646 UTF-8 encoding [RFC3629]
 *		string    service name in US-ASCII
 *		string    method name in US-ASCII
 *		....      method specific fields
 *
 * The 'user name' and 'service name' are repeated in every new authentication
 * attempt, and MAY change.  The server implementation MUST carefully check them
 * in every message, and MUST flush any accumulated authentication states if
 * they change.  If it is unable to flush an authentication state, it MUST
 * disconnect if the 'user name' or 'service name' changes.
 *
 * The 'service name' specifies the service to start after authentication. There
 * may be several different authenticated services provided.  If the requested
 * service is not available, the server MAY disconnect immediately or at any
 * later time.  Sending a proper disconnect message is RECOMMENDED. In any case,
 * if the service does not exist, authentication MUST NOT be accepted.
 *
 * If the requested 'user name' does not exist, the server MAY disconnect, or
 * MAY send a bogus list of acceptable authentication 'method name' values, but
 * never accept any.  This makes it possible for the server to avoid disclosing
 * information on which accounts exist.  In any case, if the 'user name' does
 * not exist, the authentication request MUST NOT be accepted.
 *
 * While there is usually little point for clients to send requests that the
 * server does not list as acceptable, sending such requests is not an error,
 * and the server SHOULD simply reject requests that it does not recognize.
 *
 * An authentication request MAY result in a further exchange of messages.  All
 * such messages depend on the authentication 'method name' used, and the client
 * MAY at any time continue with a new SSH_MSG_USERAUTH_REQUEST message, in
 * which case the server MUST abandon the previous authentication attempt and
 * continue with the new one.
 *
 * The following 'method name' values are defined.
 *		"publickey"             REQUIRED
 *		"password"              OPTIONAL
 *		"hostbased"             OPTIONAL
 *		"none"                  NOT RECOMMENDED

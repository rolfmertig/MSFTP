/**
 * Interface for defining an SSH identity for performing user authentication and
 * agent forwarding.<p>
 *
 * The goal of using Identity/Pubkey authentication is to remove the need for
 * static passwords. Instead of providing a password, which could be captured by
 * a keystroke logger or witnessed as you type it, you have a key pair on your
 * disk that you use to authenticate. Your account on the SSH server has a list
 * of Identities/Pubkeys that it trusts, and if you can prove you have the
 * public and private key then you are granted access without supplying a
 * password.<p>
 *
 * Some of the nice features of this form of authentication are:<p>
 * <ul>
 *		<li>No one can shoulder-surf your password and log in to your accounts;
 *			they'd need both your Identity passphrase and the private key from
 *			your machine.</li>
 *		<li>The server administrator could disable password authentication
 *			entirely, to prevent password guessing attacks.</li>
 *		<li>You can use the ssh-agent and SSH agent forwarding to have your
 *			authentication credentials 'follow' you.</li>
 *		<li>You can place restrictions on Identities/Pubkeys, for example
 *			forbidding port forwards, forcing predetermined commands, regardless
 *			of what the user wanted to run, and more.</li>
 * </ul>

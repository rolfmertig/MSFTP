/**
 * <p>Interface to define a cryptographic hash algorithm.  A cryptographic hash
 * function is a deterministic procedure that takes an arbitrary block of data
 * and returns a fixed-size bit string, the (cryptographic) hash value, such
 * that an accidental or intentional change to the data will change the hash
 * value. The data to be encoded is often called the "message", and the hash
 * value is sometimes called the message digest or simply digest.</p>
 *
 * <p><strong>Note:</strong> Implementations may not be thread-safe and should
 * be externally synchronized.</p>
 *
 * <p><strong>Note:</strong> Instances should be created using the
 * {@code HashManager} factory.</p>

/**
 * <p>A MAC (message authentication code) algorithm, sometimes called a keyed
 * (cryptographic) hash function, accepts as input a secret key and an
 * arbitrary-length message to be authenticated, and outputs a MAC (sometimes
 * known as a tag). The MAC value protects both a message's data integrity as
 * well as its authenticity, by allowing verifiers (who also possess the secret
 * key) to detect any changes to the message content.</p>
 *
 * <p>Data integrity is protected by including with each packet a MAC that is
 * computed from a shared secret, packet sequence number, and the contents of
 * the packet.</p>
 *
 * <p>The message authentication algorithm and key are negotiated during key
 * exchange.  Initially, no MAC will be in effect, and its length MUST be zero.
 * After key exchange, the 'mac' for the selected MAC algorithm will be computed
 * before encryption from the concatenation of packet data:
 * <pre>
 *		mac = MAC(key, sequence_number || unencrypted_packet)
 * </pre>
 * where unencrypted_packet is the entire packet without 'mac' (the length
 * fields, 'payload' and 'random padding'), and sequence_number is an implicit
 * packet sequence number represented as uint32.  The sequence_number is
 * initialized to zero for the first packet, and is incremented after every
 * packet (regardless of whether encryption or MAC is in use).  It is never
 * reset, even if keys/algorithms are renegotiated later.  It wraps around to
 * zero after every 2^32 packets.  The packet sequence_number itself is not
 * included in the packet sent over the wire.</p>
 *
 * <p>The MAC algorithms for each direction MUST run independently, and
 * implementations MUST allow choosing the algorithm independently for both
 * directions.  In practice however, it is RECOMMENDED that the same algorithm
 * be used in both directions.</p>
 * 
 * <p>The value of 'mac' resulting from the MAC algorithm MUST be transmitted
 * without encryption as the last part of the packet.  The number of 'mac' bytes
 * depends on the algorithm chosen.</p>
 *
 * <p>The following MAC algorithms are currently defined:
 * <pre>
 *	hmac-sha1    REQUIRED     HMAC-SHA1 (digest length = key length = 20)
 *	hmac-sha1-96 RECOMMENDED  first 96 bits of HMAC-SHA1 (digest length = 12, key length = 20)
 *	hmac-md5     OPTIONAL     HMAC-MD5 (digest length = key length = 16)
 *	hmac-md5-96  OPTIONAL     first 96 bits of HMAC-MD5 (digest length = 12, key length = 16)
 *	none         OPTIONAL     no MAC; NOT RECOMMENDED
 * </pre></p>
 * 
 * <p>The "hmac-*" algorithms are described in [RFC2104].  The "*-n" MACs use
 * only the first n bits of the resulting value.</p>
 *
 * <p><a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4253#section-6.4">RFC 4253 - The
 * Secure Shell (SSH) Transport Layer Protocol: Data Integrity</a></p>
 * <p><a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2104">RFC 2104 - HMAC: Keyed-
 * Hashing for Message Authentication</a></p>
 * 
 * <p><strong>Note:</strong> Implementations may not be thread-safe and should
 * be externally synchronized.</p>
 *
 * <p><strong>Note:</strong> Instances should be created using the
 * {@code HashManager} factory.</p>

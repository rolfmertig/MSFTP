/**
 * <p>Base implementation of a SSH request which sends a request packet over the
 * session to the specific channel and optionally waits for a response.</p>
 *
 * <p>After the key exchange, the client requests a service.  The service is
 * identified by a name.
 * <pre>
 *		byte      SSH_MSG_SERVICE_REQUEST
 *		string    service name
 * </pre></p>
 *
 * <p>If the server rejects the service request, it SHOULD send an appropriate
 * SSH_MSG_DISCONNECT message and MUST disconnect.  When the service starts, it
 * may have access to the session identifier generated during the key exchange.
 * If the server supports the service (and permits the client to use it), it
 * MUST respond with the following:
 * <pre>
 *		byte      SSH_MSG_SERVICE_ACCEPT
 *		string    service name
 * </pre></p>
 *
 * <p>Message numbers used by services should be in the area reserved for them.
 * The transport level will continue to process its own messages.</p>
